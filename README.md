# Ubuntu Setup
Bash scripts to automatically set up an ubuntu environment
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04. Should also work on Ubuntu 18.04 but some ppas are probably redundant.

## aptpkg.sh
- Perform apt upgrade
- Install tools and packages for routine development and system management
- Remove unnecessary packages
